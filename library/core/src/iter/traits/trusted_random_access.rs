/// An iterator whose items are random-accessible efficiently
///
/// # Safety
///
/// The iterator's `size_hint` must be exact and cheap to call.
///
/// `TrustedRandomAccess::size` may not be overridden.
///
/// All subtypes and all supertypes of `Self` must also implement `TrustedRandomAccess`.
/// In particular, this means that types with non-invariant parameters usually can not have
/// an impl for `TrustedRandomAccess` that depends on any trait bounds on such parameters, except
/// for bounds that come from the respective struct/enum definition itself, or bounds involving
/// traits that themselves come with a guarantee similar to this one.
///
/// If `Self: ExactSizeIterator` then `self.len()` must always produce results consistent
/// with `self.size()`.
///
/// If `Self: Iterator`, then `<Self as Iterator>::__iterator_get_unchecked(&mut self, idx)`
/// must be safe to call provided the following conditions are met.
///
/// 1. `0 <= idx` and `idx < self.size()`.
/// 2. If `Self: !Clone`, then `self.__iterator_get_unchecked(idx)` is never called with the same
///    index on `self` more than once.
/// 3. After `self.__iterator_get_unchecked(idx)` has been called, then `self.next_back()` will
///    only be called at most `self.size() - idx - 1` times. If `Self: Clone` and `self` is cloned,
///    then this number is calculated for `self` and its clone individually,
///    but `self.next_back()` calls that happened before the cloning count for both `self` and the clone.
/// 4. After `self.__iterator_get_unchecked(idx)` has been called, then only the following methods
///    will be called on `self` or on any new clones of `self`:
///     * `std::clone::Clone::clone`
///     * `std::iter::Iterator::size_hint`
///     * `std::iter::DoubleEndedIterator::next_back`
///     * `std::iter::ExactSizeIterator::len`
///     * `std::iter::Iterator::__iterator_get_unchecked`
///     * `std::iter::TrustedRandomAccess::size`
///
/// Further, given that these conditions are met, it must guarantee that:
///
/// * It does not change the value returned from `size_hint`
/// * It must be safe to call the methods listed above on `self` after calling
///   `self.__iterator_get_unchecked(idx)`, assuming that the required traits are implemented.
/// * It must also be safe to drop `self` after calling `self.__iterator_get_unchecked(idx)`.

// FIXME: Clarify interaction with SourceIter/InPlaceIterable. Calling `SourceIter::as_inner`
// after `__iterator_get_unchecked` is supposed to be allowed.
